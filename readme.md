## 🛡️ PathRakshak — Strategic Convoy Routing System for the Indian Army

**PathRakshak** is a student-driven prototype created to assist the Indian Army in planning the safest and most efficient convoy routes during war and high-risk operations. It uses real-time intelligence, AI algorithms, and geospatial mapping to avoid threat zones like ambush areas or regions vulnerable to enemy strikes.

Inspired by tragic incidents such as the Pulwama attack, this tool is designed to reduce risk to soldiers and optimize strategic movement on the ground. PathRakshak is not a product or startup—it is a patriotic idea submitted in service of national defense.
